We will never sleep 'cause sleep is for the weak
No, we will never rest 'til we're all fucking dead
I refuse! I refuse!
I refuse to close my eyes!
I have loved, and I have lost.
I have turned, and I have tossed.
I have listened, and I have watched.
I've gave into this for long enough!
I have lost, and I have loved.
Sleep has stolen far too much.
So don't close your eyes, not just yet
Sleep is just a cousin of death!
I've said it before, and I'll say it again
If you think you're alive then you're better off dead
I've said it before, and I'll say it again
If you think you're alive then you're better off dead
I have loved, and I have lost.
I have turned, and I have tossed.
I have listened, and I have watched.
I've gave into this for long enough!
I have lost, and I have loved.
Sleep has stolen far too much.
So don't close your eyes, not just yet
Sleep is just a cousin of death!
So throw your diamonds in the sky, we'll stay gold forever?
So throw your diamonds in the sky, we'll stay gold forever?
I can promise you one thing: death will take us all!
I can promise you one thing: you will die alone!
We're all going to Hell, we may as well go out in style!
Death is a promise, and your life is a fucking lie!
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
We will never sleep, 'cause sleep is for the weak
And we will never rest, 'til we're all fucking dead
I refuse! I refuse!
I refuse to close my eyes!
