I woke up in a warehouse
But the label had fell off
Just minding my own meltdown
It was then I heard the cannibals, cannibals
They said, hey kid
You got that something special
(It's now or never)
You wanna live forever
(It's now or never)
You know what we want, you should give it to us
(It's now or never)
(But there's no pressure)
And I keep picking petals
I'm afraid you don't love me anymore
'Cause a kid on the 'gram in a Black Dahlia tank
Says it ain't heavy metal
(And that's alright)
(That's alright)
I tried to do a headcount
But I cut off all the crusts
Said they liked it better curly
Then they gut me like an animal, animal
They said, hey man
You had that something special
(It's now or never)
Let's keep it quintessential
(It's now or never)
You know what we want, why not give it to us?
(It's now or never)
(But there's no pressure)
So I keep picking petals
I'm afraid you don't love me anymore
'Cause a kid on the 'gram in a Black Dahlia tank
Says it ain't heavy metal
Yeah I keep picking petals
Got my heart and my head all in the wars
'Cause some kid from A&R in a Patagonia
Says he don't really get it, no
So I keep picking petals
All I wanna know do you love me anymore
'Cause some kid on the 'gram said he used to be a fan
But this shit ain't heavy metal
(And that's alright)
And I keep picking petals
I'm afraid you don't love me anymore
'Cause a kid on the 'gram in a Black Dahlia tank
Says it ain't heavy metal
And I keep picking petals
I'm afraid you don't love me anymore
'Cause a kid on the 'gram said he used to be a fan
But this shit ain't heavy metal
No, this ain't heavy metal
No, this ain't heavy metal
