Tu as tué mon bébé
Na, na, na, na
Na, na, na, na, na, na, na
Na, na, na, na
Na, na, na, na
Na, na, na, na, na, na, na
Na, na, na, na
I always knew this is gonna end in tears
Didn't think your wrists would keep a souvenir
And I thought that I had heard it all
Till I heard your lover screaming down the phone
I know I said I was under your spell
But this hex is on another level
And I know I said you could drag me through Hell
But I hoped you wouldn't fuck the Devil
Na, na, na, na
Na, na, na, na, na, na, na
Na, na, na, na
Na, na, na, na, na, na, na
This was gonna end in tears
Didn't think your wrists would keep a souvenir
And I thought that I had it all
Till I heard your lover screaming down the phone
I know I said I was under your spell
But this hex is on another level
And I know I said you could drag me through Hell
But I hoped you wouldn't fuck the Devil
