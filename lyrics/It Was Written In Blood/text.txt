Goodbye my friend, goodbye my love, you're in my heart
It was preordained that we should part,
and be united by and by, united by and by.
Goodbye no handshake to endure.
Now there's nothing.
It was written in blood
It was written in blood
It was written in blood
Oh god, written in blood
It was written in blood
It was written in blood
Oh my god, it was written in blood
Let's have no sadness, furrowed brow.
There's nothing new in dying now.
Though living is no newer...
And it was written in blood.
It was written in blood
It was written in blood
It was written in blood
Oh my god, it was written in blood
It was written in blood
It was written in blood
Oh my god!
It was written... in blood
On a suicide note
Like roses, we blossom then die
Like roses, we've fallen apart
Like roses, we blossom then die
Like roses, we've fallen apart
Though living is no newer
(It was written in blood, on a fucking suicide note, the day before he died)
It was written in blood
It was written in blood
It was written in blood
My god, written in blood
It was written in blood
It was written in blood
Oh my god!
It was written... in blood
Like roses, we blossom then die
Like roses, we blossom then die
We've fallen apart (Fallen apart!)
We've fallen apart (Fallen apart!)
Fallen apart
We fall, like roses
Like roses
Roses...
Like roses...
