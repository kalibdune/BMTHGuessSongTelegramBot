Fuck you,
You took what you wanted and left, like locusts.
Everything I gave to you, everything that we've been through
You bled me dry and then left, like leeches.
Go, you got what you could now leave, like vultures
Ripped apart in minutes what was built in seven years
The ink scarred on your back may as well have disappeared
For as long as I remember, you sold everything you owned
But now you sold our friendship, you're on your fucking own.
Sleep with one eye open,
Because
Sleep with one eye open
(Cause)
If I had it my way I'd slit your throat with the knife that you left in my back
All this shame, all this guilt, all this regret, that's me
I'm inside of you
And this is your world
Fucking falling apart mate, from the inside out.
Everything will fall apart at the seams
You got hell to pay
Yeah, you got hell to pay
And you better fucking bow, bow down to me
You better beg for mercy
Get on your fucking knees and cry me a fucking river
Sleep with one eye open
Because
Sleep with one eye open
Best friends means forever
Cunt.
