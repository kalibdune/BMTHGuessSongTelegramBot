I've been climbing up the walls
To escape the sinking feeling
But I can't hide from the nihilist at my door
Buried in the basement floor
Didn't know what I had planted
It blossomed with all the heart of a cold war
I'm a spirit in a tomb
Won't somebody raise the roof
I'm going white, I'm going black, I'm going blue
Do you mind if I'm exhumed?
I'm the ashes in the plume
I'm a beggar in the ruin
I'm peaking out, I'm burning up, I'm shooting through
I'm only lonely for the true
Paradise is in my soul
And I'm terrified I can't get out
I'm lost in a labyrinth
We are lost in a labyrinth
Paradise is in my soul
And I'm terrified I can't get out
I'm lost in a labyrinth
We are lost in a labyrinth
Please don't follow
Paradise is in my soul
And I'm terrified I can't get out
I'm lost in a labyrinth
We are lost in a labyrinth
Please don't follow
Light as a feather, stiff as a board
Sink to the floor, I sink to the floor
I sink to the floor
Light as a feather, stiff as a board
You were in my dream last night
But your face was someone else's
A twitch in my spine, a mutual disorder
Isolation neophyte
Too afraid to taste your conscience
You march in the dark, little lamb to the slaughter
I'm a spirit in a tomb
Won't somebody raise the roof
I'm going white, I'm going black, I'm going blue
Do you mind if I'm exhumed?
I'm the ashes in the plume
I'm a beggar in the ruin
I'm peaking out, I'm burning up, I'm shooting through
I'm only lonely for the true
Paradise is in my soul
And I'm terrified I can't get out
I'm lost in a labyrinth
We are lost in a labyrinth
Please don't follow
Paradise is in my soul
And I'm terrified I can't get out
I'm lost in a labyrinth
We are lost in a labyrinth
Please don't follow
Please don't follow
Please don't follow
Please don't follow
Please don't follow
(Please don't follow)
I've been climbing up the walls
To escape the sinking feeling
But I can't hide from the nihilist at my door
